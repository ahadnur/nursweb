        <p class="lead">MAIN INTEREST IN WEB DEVELOMENT AND DESIGN</p>
        <p>
          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. In the winter, I go to the hills and if anywhere play
          badminton. During summer seasion playing indoor games is like fun. I
          enjoy cycling, free climbing, and walking alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          When forced indoors, I watch a number of science-fiction and fantasy
          genre movies and play racing games, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend
          a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy
          advancements in the front-end as well as back-end web development
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once upon a time i used to gardening, after growing up i was used to
          paint. Painting gave me much pleasure and now all my interset fall on
          new technologies and programming and after knowing the word
          programming it takes my day and night from me. I just love it.
        </p>
        <p>If the interest goes to eat, I have to say, Love BIRIYANI a lot.</p>
